* add form validation for poll
* put Twitter Auth in heroku app (on Setting Page, I think) & test that it works
* get New Poll button to load newpoll component
* hide newpoll component from Main Page when no user is signed in
* Add Twitter profile pic to navbar  
* rearrange components etc to be more sensical...make panel tabs for New Poll work...
